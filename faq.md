### Can I use OpenSanctions commercially?

Feel free to. OpenSanctions offers a set of open-source scrapers for sanctions
and PEP information that can be used freely.

However, while it is our goal to achieve a similar level of comprehensiveness
to paid products like World-Check or WorldCompliance, OpenSanctions currently
is a proof of concept and does not contain relatives and close associates of
many key persons. For users who need to meet formal compliance requirements,
OpenSanctions cannot replace commercial products yet.
