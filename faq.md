### What is OpenSanctions?

OpenSanctions brings together sanctions lists, lists of politically exposed
persons (PEPs), and parties excluded from government contracts in different countries.
It is a list of persons and companies of political, criminal, or economic
significance that merit further investigation.

It is meant to be a resource for journalists and civil society who need to
perform due diligence-style tasks (e.g. searching for persons of interest in
a leak or open dataset).

OpenSanctions is an open project, meaning anyone is invited to use the dataset
and contribute additional information.

### Where does the data come from?

Our preferred sources are official datasets published by governments all over
the world; including commonly used sanctions and ban lists such as:

* US Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially-designated Nationals
* United Nations Security Council sanctions list
* European External Action Service consolidated sanctions
* MySociety's EveryPolitician.org list of parliamentarians
* EU Who is Who phone directory
* ... many other sources

### How frequently is OpenSanctions updated?

### Does OpenSanctions only contain sanctions lists?

No, we are just bad at naming things. OpenSanctions contains sanctions lists,
lists of politicians, ban lists used in government procurement, lists of known
terrorists and many other data sources relevant to journalistic research and
due diligence.

### Can I use OpenSanctions commercially?

Feel free to. OpenSanctions offers a set of open-source scrapers for sanctions
and PEP information that can be used freely.

However, while it is our goal to achieve a similar level of comprehensiveness
to paid products like World-Check or WorldCompliance, OpenSanctions currently
is a proof of concept and does not contain relatives and close associates of
many key persons. For users who need to meet formal compliance requirements,
OpenSanctions cannot replace commercial products yet.

### Can I contribute a new data source?

Yes! We're particularly keen to add sources that include information from
criminal cases, and family and associates of politically exposed persons.

Our data sources are currently set up as independent repositories inside the
opensanctions organisation on GitHub. Please file a ticket with the main
repository to suggest a new source and get access to contribute.
